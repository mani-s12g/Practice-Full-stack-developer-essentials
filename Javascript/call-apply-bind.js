// what is bind method ?
// Bind method - It looks exactly like call method, but instead of calling the function directly like call, what bind does
// is that, it binds printFullName method with object name2 and returns us the copy of that method

// bind method 
// doesnt call fn directly like call and apply methods, but returns the function which we can call later as below
let printNameUsingBind = printFullName.bind(name2, "Mumbai", "maharashtra");
console.log(printNameUsingBind); // returns printFullName fn
printNameUsingBind();

// line 52: creates the copy of printFullName method and it will bind that with name2 object and returns that fn, but it doesnt directly 
// calls this method (printFullName) as in call, bind method only returns us the copy of that printFullName method, 
// which we can call later


// call method
// It will invoke a fn directly by passing in the reference which points to the 'this' variable inside the method (printFullName)

// apply method
// It is exactly same as the call method, only difference is that it takes 2nd arguments as a array list of the parameter which needs to passed to the printFullName fn
